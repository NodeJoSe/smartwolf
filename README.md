eCommerce prototype website made in the university with Node.js "Mean stack"

Note: this was my first project made with a partner, so, i did not followed a good structure with angular, i might restructure it later, there are 3 main files:  

	app.controller.js contains all the controllers

	app.service.js contains all the services

	app.config.js contains the config and routes
	
Server side looks more organized thought, made with with express and mongoose.
